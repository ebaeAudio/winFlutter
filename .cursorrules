You are working in the `winFlutter` repo (Flutter).

Always read and follow:
- `agentPrompt.md` (authoritative product + UX requirements)
- `docs/FRONTEND_SPEC.md` (how UI should be built in this repo)

Frontend / Flutter rules:
- Prefer Flutter Material 3 widgets and the existing theme in `lib/app/theme.dart`. Do not introduce a new design system package unless explicitly asked.
- Use `AppScaffold` (`lib/ui/app_scaffold.dart`) for screens to keep padding/max-width consistent.
- Use the spacing scale in `lib/ui/spacing.dart` (`AppSpace` + `Gap`) instead of ad-hoc magic numbers.
- Keep UI accessible: good contrast, readable font sizes, touch targets >= 44px, and clear error states.

Code hygiene:
- Keep widgets small and composable; move reusable UI into `lib/ui/components/`.
- Prefer deterministic UI behavior over “clever” animations; only add animation when it improves clarity.
