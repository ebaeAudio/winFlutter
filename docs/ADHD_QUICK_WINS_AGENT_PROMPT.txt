Implement the 8 ADHD Quick Wins from docs/ADHD_IMPROVEMENTS_RECOMMENDATIONS.md. These are low-effort, high-impact improvements for ADHD users.

QUICK WINS TO IMPLEMENT:

1. Visual Progress Indicators for Timer
   - Add circular progress ring around timer
   - Add shrinking "time remaining" bar
   - Color transitions: green → yellow → red (based on % remaining)
   - Modify: lib/features/today/widgets/focus_action_lane.dart

2. Explain "Why" in Notifications/Prompts
   - Add brief rationale to all prompts (1 sentence max)
   - Examples: "You set 3 Must-Wins today. 2 are done. Time to tackle the last one?"
   - Update coach messages, focus prompts, notifications

3. Graded Prompts (Start Small)
   - Morning: "What's your one Must-Win today?" (not "plan your whole day")
   - Afternoon: "How's that Must-Win going?" (not "complete everything")
   - Evening: "Quick reflection: what helped today?" (not long journal)
   - Break large actions into micro-steps

4. Transition Checklists When Timer Ends
   - When timebox ends, show "Wrap up checklist" bottom sheet:
     - "Save your work" (checkbox)
     - "Note where you left off" (text input → saves to task notes)
     - "Set next session focus" (optional)
   - Create: lib/features/today/widgets/wrap_up_checklist_sheet.dart

5. "Where Was I?" Resume Feature
   - Add "Resume" card on Today screen when user had interrupted work
   - Show: "You were working on [task] for [X] minutes"
   - Tapping resume restores focus mode with that task
   - Persist last active task in local storage

6. Context Save on Task Switch
   - When switching focus task, optional prompt: "Quick note: where did you leave off?"
   - Auto-saves to task notes
   - When returning to task, show "Last time: [context note]"
   - Non-intrusive, optional

7. Dyslexia-Friendly Font Option
   - Add font picker in Settings → Appearance
   - Options: "System Default" | "Dyslexia-Friendly"
   - Apply globally via theme
   - May need open_dyslexic package or system accessibility font

8. Reduce Motion / Animation Controls
   - Respect system "Reduce Motion" setting
   - Add "Reduce Animations" toggle in Settings
   - When enabled: disable/minimize celebratory animations (W-drop, etc.)
   - Keep essential UI animations minimal

REQUIREMENTS:
- Follow existing design system (AppScaffold, Gap, AppSpace, theme.dart)
- Maintain ADHD-first UX: one path, small commitments, gentle recovery
- Keep UI accessible: ≥44px touch targets, good contrast
- Settings persist across app restarts
- No regressions in existing features
