## Win the Year (Flutter) — Improvements & Buildout Checklist

This checklist turns the current scaffold into a **professional, personal-feeling** MVP with parity to the PRD in `agentPrompt.md`.

### How to use this doc
- **Work sequentially**: do items `1.x` → `2.x` → `3.x`, etc.
- **Or batch by range**: e.g. “implement 1–2 (design + navigation)”, then “3–5 (Today)”.
- Each item includes:
  - **Goal**
  - **Acceptance criteria**
  - **Suggested implementation notes**
  - **Likely files**

---

## 0) Baseline hygiene (small, high-leverage)

### 0.1 Add a lightweight docs structure (optional)
- [ ] **Goal**: Keep docs discoverable as the app grows.
- [ ] **Acceptance criteria**:
  - [ ] `README.md` links to this checklist (and any future docs).
- [ ] **Likely files**: `README.md`

### 0.2 Add app-wide copy tone guidelines (personal + consistent)
- [ ] **Goal**: Make the app feel like one “voice” (coach-y but calm, consistent microcopy).
- [ ] **Acceptance criteria**:
  - [ ] A short “Voice & tone” section exists (1–2 paragraphs + examples).
  - [ ] Key screens use consistent phrasing (empty states, errors, confirmations).
- [ ] **Likely files**: `IMPROVEMENTS_CHECKLIST.md` (this doc), later `lib/app/strings.dart` (if you centralize copy)

---

## 1) Design system + UI polish (make it feel professional)

> Current state: Material 3 is enabled, but theme is mostly just a seed color (`lib/app/theme.dart`). Screens use direct `Padding + ListView + Card` with ad-hoc spacing.

### 1.1 Define a spacing scale + reusable gaps
- [ ] **Goal**: Consistent rhythm everywhere.
- [ ] **Acceptance criteria**:
  - [ ] A single spacing scale exists (e.g. 4/8/12/16/24/32).
  - [ ] Screens stop using “random” values and instead use the scale.
- [ ] **Implementation notes**:
  - [ ] Create `lib/ui/spacing.dart` with constants (e.g. `s4, s8, s12, s16, s24`).
  - [ ] Optional: small widgets like `Gap.h16`, etc.
- [ ] **Likely files**: `lib/ui/spacing.dart`, all screens in `lib/features/**`

### 1.2 Create a standard page scaffold wrapper
- [ ] **Goal**: Consistent padding, max width on larger screens, scroll behavior, safe areas.
- [ ] **Acceptance criteria**:
  - [ ] New `AppScaffold` used by all major screens (Today/Rollups/Settings/Auth).
  - [ ] On tablet/web widths, content is centered with a max width (e.g. 560–720).
- [ ] **Implementation notes**:
  - [ ] `AppScaffold(title, body, actions, bottomNav?)`.
  - [ ] Wrap body in `SafeArea` and `Align + ConstrainedBox`.
- [ ] **Likely files**: `lib/ui/app_scaffold.dart`, screens in `lib/features/**`

### 1.3 Upgrade theme from “seed only” to a cohesive system
- [ ] **Goal**: A distinct, modern look with consistent component styling.
- [ ] **Acceptance criteria**:
  - [ ] `ThemeData` defines at least:
    - [ ] `textTheme` (headline/body/label scale tuned)
    - [ ] `appBarTheme`
    - [ ] `cardTheme` (shape + surface tint behavior)
    - [ ] `inputDecorationTheme` (filled/outline style, consistent padding)
    - [ ] `filledButtonTheme` / `outlinedButtonTheme`
    - [ ] `segmentedButtonTheme`
    - [ ] `dividerTheme`
    - [ ] `snackBarTheme`
  - [ ] Light + dark both look intentional (not “default dark”).
- [ ] **Implementation notes**:
  - [ ] Keep 4 theme seeds, but define “surface language” (corner radius, elevation, container colors).
  - [ ] Consider `ColorScheme.fromSeed(...).copyWith(...)` for better surface contrast.
- [ ] **Likely files**: `lib/app/theme.dart`

### 1.4 Add a small component set (to avoid repeated UI patterns)
- [ ] **Goal**: Screens become compositional and consistent.
- [ ] **Acceptance criteria**:
  - [ ] Reusable widgets exist for:
    - [ ] `SectionHeader` (title + optional trailing action)
    - [ ] `EmptyStateCard` (icon + title + description + CTA)
    - [ ] `InfoBanner` (neutral/warn/error styles)
    - [ ] `PrimaryActionBar` (sticky bottom actions on forms, if desired)
- [ ] **Likely files**: `lib/ui/components/**` or `lib/ui/widgets/**`

### 1.5 Improve accessibility + touch ergonomics
- [ ] **Goal**: Better usability and “polish”.
- [ ] **Acceptance criteria**:
  - [ ] Tap targets are ≥ 44px.
  - [ ] Text contrast is sufficient in light/dark.
  - [ ] Inputs have helpful labels and error text (not just red `Text()`).
  - [ ] `Semantics` labels exist for non-textual controls where needed.
- [ ] **Likely files**: theme + all feature screens

---

## 2) Navigation & app structure (product-shaped, not a demo menu)

> Current state: `/home` is a list of buttons; subroutes are `/home/today`, `/home/rollups`, `/home/settings`.

### 2.1 Move to a bottom navigation shell (recommended)
- [ ] **Goal**: Make the app feel like a real mobile product: Today / Rollups / Settings.
- [ ] **Acceptance criteria**:
  - [ ] Bottom nav is persistent across primary tabs.
  - [ ] Back button behavior is sane (tab navigation doesn’t stack weirdly).
  - [ ] Deep links still work.
- [ ] **Implementation notes**:
  - [ ] Use `go_router` `ShellRoute` with `NavigationBar`.
  - [ ] Consider making Today the default initial route.
- [ ] **Likely files**: `lib/app/router.dart`, `lib/features/home/home_screen.dart` (may become shell), new `lib/ui/nav_shell.dart`

### 2.2 Decide what “Home” becomes (choose one)
- [ ] **Option A (simplest)**: Remove Home as a screen; “Today” is the landing tab.
- [ ] **Option B**: Keep Home as a light dashboard (today score preview + quick add task).
- [ ] **Acceptance criteria**:
  - [ ] There is a single obvious “start here” experience.
- [ ] **Likely files**: `lib/app/router.dart`, `lib/features/home/home_screen.dart`

### 2.3 Routing polish: safe redirects + “return to next”
- [ ] **Goal**: After signing in, return to the intended page.
- [ ] **Acceptance criteria**:
  - [ ] Auth flow supports a safe `next=` relative path.
  - [ ] Redirect logic doesn’t lose the user’s original intent.
- [ ] **Likely files**: `lib/app/router.dart`, `lib/features/auth/auth_screen.dart`

---

## 3) Data layer foundations (Supabase + Demo mode parity)

> Current state: demo mode affects auth state, but there’s no local data persistence layer for tasks/habits/reflections yet.

### 3.1 Define domain models
- [ ] **Goal**: Use consistent types across Supabase + demo/local implementations.
- [ ] **Acceptance criteria**:
  - [ ] Models exist for:
    - [ ] Task
    - [ ] Habit
    - [ ] HabitCompletion (or computed map)
    - [ ] DailyReflection
    - [ ] DailyScore (derived)
  - [ ] JSON serialization exists (manual or via small helpers).
- [ ] **Likely files**: `lib/domain/**` or `lib/models/**`

### 3.2 Create repositories with two implementations: Supabase + Local
- [ ] **Goal**: Same UI works in both real and demo mode.
- [ ] **Acceptance criteria**:
  - [ ] `TasksRepository`, `HabitsRepository`, `ReflectionsRepository`, `RollupsRepository` interfaces exist.
  - [ ] Supabase implementation uses authenticated user + RLS tables.
  - [ ] Local implementation uses `SharedPreferences` (or a better local DB if you choose later).
  - [ ] Switching is automatic based on `Env.demoMode` or Supabase configured state.
- [ ] **Implementation notes**:
  - [ ] For SharedPreferences, store per-user or per-demo data under stable keys.
  - [ ] Keep local schema versioned (`data_version`) to allow resets/migrations.
- [ ] **Likely files**: `lib/data/**`, `lib/app/env.dart`, `lib/app/supabase.dart`

### 3.3 Add a “Reset demo data” control
- [ ] **Goal**: Demo mode should be safe to experiment with.
- [ ] **Acceptance criteria**:
  - [ ] A settings control exists: “Reset demo data”.
  - [ ] Confirm dialog appears; reset clears demo keys and returns to an empty state.
- [ ] **Likely files**: `lib/features/settings/settings_screen.dart`, local repo implementation

> **PRD**: [`docs/IOS_CUSTOM_SHIELD_TASK_CALLOUT_PRD.md`](docs/IOS_CUSTOM_SHIELD_TASK_CALLOUT_PRD.md)  
> **Complexity**: High (requires native iOS extension targets)

When users try to open a blocked app during Dumb Phone mode, show a **cheeky, personalized shield** with one of their remaining tasks instead of the generic iOS "App Blocked" screen.

**Example:**
```
🔥 Nice try, champ.
